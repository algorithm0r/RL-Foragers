# rllayers

Layered / receptive-field tabular Q-learning for forager agents in discrete toroidal grid
worlds — a reusable, reliable policy-learning component for agent-based models.

A browser-based agent-based simulation (vanilla JS + Canvas, no build step), scaffolded from
the shared engine v2.

## Run
- **Browser:** open `index.html`.
- **Headless batch:** `node runner.mjs --reps 50` — runs the same sim core in the main V8 realm
  (indirect `eval`, not `vm` — avoids vm's hot-loop tax; see `~/.claude/conventions.md` §4) and
  writes self-describing packets to MongoDB through the research Server.
- **Smoke test:** `node smoketest.mjs` — no DB; asserts the model invariant and prints metrics.

## Layout
- `src/` — sim core (`engine`, `params`, `world`, `agent`, `observer`, `datamanager`, `charts`,
  `util`) + `db.js` (vendored standard DB client) + `ui.js`/`main.js` (browser-only, all DOM).
- `runner.mjs` / `smoketest.mjs` — headless entry points.
- `DEVPLAN.md` / `DEVLOG.md` — the plan (forward) and the log (backward, append-only).

See `~/.claude/conventions.md` for the shared standards this follows.
